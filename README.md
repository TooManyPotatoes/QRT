# QRT
This is the software repository for the Quarknet Radio Telescope, a project at Fermilab to design and build a radio telescope with local high school students from Batavia High School and Marmion Academy. There are currently three core parts:

1. *notes:* Some background material on various aspects of radio instrumentation and astronomy.
2. *software:* Production-level control and data acquisition software for the telescope, being developed in a piecemeal fashion as the project evolves.
3. *tutorials:* Jupyter notebooks that introduce the basic aspects of programming, signal processing, physics, etc., which are relevant to the project.
4. *instructions* Instructions on how to assemble the radio telescope.
